## 💫 About Me

Hi, I am Prathamesh, an aspiring Data Scientist with a sheer obsession for music & computers, currently working at MetaBrainz.org as a Google Summer of Code '22 Contributor.

Back in 6th grade, I started tinkering around with computers and developed a severe passion for technology, making it a highlight of most of my teen life.

5 years ago I developed a similar passion for making & consuming insane amounts of music.
Given my 3+ years of experience in Music Production, playing Piano, & Audio Engineering under my artist alias “SNÆK” & a life-long love for computers, my passion in the world of audio and technology has now convolved into a passion for Data Science and AI involving various audio Technologies!

And as a 3rd-year undergrad, I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Data Science -> IIT Madras & AI -> GHRCEM Pune respectively.

As a 2nd-year undergrad, I am currently pursuing degrees in Data Science -> IIT Madras & AI -> GHRCEM Pune respectively.
