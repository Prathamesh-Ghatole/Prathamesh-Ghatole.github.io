- **AI for Oil Drilling**: Architected a hybrid ML system from the ground up, combining classification, entity extraction, and proprietary algorithms to infer drilling operations & parameters and reconstruct activity timelines from unstructured reports with 95%+ accuracy, saving 4 hrs/well across 1000s of wells.

- Selected a combination of small LLMs (qwen, gpt-oss, gemini), fast fine-tuned transformer models (BERT, GLiNER), and decision trees to meet strict latency and cost constraints. Implemented context-aware corrections and domain-specific guardrails to ensure physically consistent outputs.

- **Data mining**: Engineered a pipeline to mine structured insights from PDFs using multi-modal LLMs (gemini-2.5-flash) with pre-defined schemas, few shot examples, and text rules; outperformed SOTA tools like Docling for our use case. Optimized w/ annotation caching, input pruning, etc.

- **Vessel & Fuel Analytics**: Designed a data warehousing solution & a Dagster pipeline to process vessel telemetry & geospatial data, saving clients $1.2M annually in fuel costs through clever fuel reporting using PostgreSQL, Dagster, Polars, Power BI.

- **Leadership**: Promoted to technical lead, responsible for architectural decisions and team building to drive automation, platform modernization. Led the delivery of 10+ mission-critical projects with a team of 6 engineers.
