- Enriched, cleaned, and combined 27 billion rows of music streaming data using Python (Pandas, Multiprocessing), SQL (PostgreSQL), and Apache Arrow – achieving high efficiency in Python without Spark. [Details](https://community.metabrainz.org/t/clean-up-the-music-listening-histories-dataset-gsoc-2022-proposal/579503)

- Researched and implemented technologies like Zstandard and Apache Arrow to optimize data lake efficiency, resulting in a 53% reduction in storage and a 9% improvement in read/write speeds.[Details](https://blog.metabrainz.org/2022/10/28/cleaning-up-the-music-listening-histories-dataset/)

- Performed data analytics and published benchmarks, dashboards, and reports to help collaborating teams better understand and utilize the data to train state-of-the-art Music Recommendation Systems. [Project Summary](https://blog.metabrainz.org/?p=9785)
