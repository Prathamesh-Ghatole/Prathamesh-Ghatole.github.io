# üí´ About Me

Hello, I'm Prathamesh, a seasoned Data Engineer & Analyst with a knack for turning raw data into actionable insights. With 2+ years of experience, and expertise in Data Extraction, Data Integration, Web Scraping, ETL, and Data Analytics, I've slashed costs by thousands of $$$ for my clients in Open Source and Corporate domains.

Back in 4th grade, I started tinkering around with computers and developed a severe passion for technology, making it a highlight of most of my teen life. 6 years ago I developed a similar passion for making & consuming insane amounts of music. Given my 3+ years of experience in Music Production, playing Piano, & Audio Engineering under my artist alias ‚ÄúSN√ÜK‚Äù & a lifelong love for computers, my passion for the world of music and technology has now convolved into a passion for Data and AI involving various audio Technologies!

With proven work experience at competitive programs like Google Summer of Code, delivering excellent results to my freelance client, and a background in Artificial Intelligence, I bring a blend of expertise to leverage data and drive results.
