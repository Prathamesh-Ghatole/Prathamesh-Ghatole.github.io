# üí´ About Me

Hi, I am Prathamesh, an aspiring Data Engineer & Analyst based in Pune with a sheer obsession for data, music, computers, and open-source software.

Back in 4th grade, I started tinkering around with computers and developed a severe passion for technology, making it a highlight of most of my teen life. 6 years ago I developed a similar passion for making & consuming insane amounts of music. Given my 3+ years of experience in Music Production, playing Piano, & Audio Engineering under my artist alias ‚ÄúSN√ÜK‚Äù & a lifelong love for computers, my passion for the world of music and technology has now convolved into a passion for Data and AI involving various audio Technologies!

I've 5+ months of experience, working as a Google Summer of Code '22 contributor @MetaBrainz where I've optimized, transformed, and cleaned 600+GBs of data and created various dashboards, ran benchmarks, and generated reports - aiding in the successful cleanup of the massive Music Listening Histories Dataset! I also love teaching and have worked as a Machine Learning Teaching Assistant at GHRCEM, Pune - instructing 70+ sophomores about the practical applications of ML.

And as a 3rd-year undergrad, I am currently pursuing a BS in Data Science and applications at IIT Madras, and a BTech. in AI at GHRCEM Pune, where my friends know me for my enthusiasm & weird sense of humor, and my teachers know me for my perseverance and reliability.

# üèóÔ∏è Projects:

#### lastfm-scraper | [```üîó Project Demo```](http://lastfm-scraper.azurewebsites.net) | [```üîó Codebase```](https://github.com/Prathamesh-Ghatole/lastfm-scraper)

  - [```Last.fm```](https://www.last.fm/) offers services that allow users to track their music listening histories across multiple streaming services. However, I realized there was no way to download my own listening history for my own use! Inspired by Spotify Wrapped, I was hell-bent on utilizing this data for exciting analytics and machine learning applications. This is why I developed my own scraper to scrape my listening history by leveraging the last.fm API. The goal of this project is to scrape, process & deliver user data into accessible formats like CSV and JSON.
