<!-- original version -->
Hi, I’m Prathamesh. I build and own end-to-end production data systems, ML and robust data pipelines under real-world constraints. I bring strong open-source experience and a formal Data Science background, with an emphasis on systems that scale, fail gracefully, and get used.
